I rely heavily on CSS to optimize color, padding, overlays, and graphic animation to make the page look stunningly beautiful and interactive, and I utilize QuerySelector in Javascript to functionalize price card, side-bar menu, Contact Us card, and other graphi animations. The implementations of motion-graphics add another layer of interactive design to the website as well.
